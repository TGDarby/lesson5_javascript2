### Project Description:
This assignment's finished product is a calculator that determines how much a given US dollar amount is worth in one of fifteen selectable currencies based on their exchange rates. This involved the creation of the dropdown list of currencies in HTML, the setting of variables for the various currency exchange rates in JavaScript, the calculation of those given exchange rates, and the clearing of the displayed outputs to make way for more calculations.

### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One lesson I learned during the completion of this assignment was more or less a hold over from the previous lesson: the difference between the assignment operator "=" and the relational operator "==". The assignment operator assigns a value to a variable and is used in the statement portion of an if or else if statement; The relational operator should be used in the condition portion of an if or else if statement, as this determines whether or not the programming code of the statement will be executed.
2. If and else if statements can be used to evaluate whether or not several potential inputs are true and can execute the corresponding programming code accordingly.
3. The document.getElementById method can be used to select both HTML and input values and can clear said values to make way for new inputs and outputs, or change those values back to some default state.
